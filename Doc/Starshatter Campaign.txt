
==================== STARSHATTER ==================== 
                      STRATEGY

Although Starshatter is fundamentally an action title,
there is also a significant back-story and strategic
element to the gameplay.

The game occurs in a far-distant future of the Milky
Way galaxy.  Our corner of the galaxy, an area some
ten or twenty thousand light years in diameter is popu-
lated by thousands of human-intelligent species on tens
of thousands of worlds.  Many races live in approximate
isolation, but most are organized into complex poly-
specific civilizations spanning many star systems.
Humans are not central in galactic affairs (as in Star
Trek or Star Wars) but are merely another species.  And
some of the other species and civilizations are *much*
older and *much* more advanced than ours.


POLITICAL FACTIONS:

- Starshatter (warlike/imperial power)

* Sterat Empire (controlled by the Starshatter)

* Brenel Core (military/intelligence corporation)

* Zolon Empire (hive-like hereditary empire)

* Marakan Hegemony (Failing human imperial civilization)

* Terellian Alliance (peaceful commerce group)
  Alliance of Terellian Republics (ATR)

+ Ele'aan Fusion (peaceful/isolationist power)

The player is a human starfighter pilot in the military
of one such civilization, the Terellian Alliance or ATR.
The computer plays the part of the player's superior
officers in assigning missions and offering criticism
and praise for performance.  In addition, the computer
plays the role of all enemy pilots and politicians.

The game follows the action in an interstellar conflict
between the Terellian Alliance and those civilizations in
the control of the Starshatter.  The player is assigned
missions and ships commensurate with his ability by the
computer.

==================== STARSHATTER ==================== 
                      MISSIONS

Each of the three episodes follows the action in a military
campaign against a single enemy civilization.  Individual
missions will be constructed on the fly by the dynamic
campaign manager (or by the player if acting as operational
commander).

Each episode takes place in a fixed volume of space con-
taining about a dozen star systems.  The global campaign
map will treat the star systems as points in a 2D map.
The action will take place within individual star systems,
which use a finer grained map.  The enemy will control
most of the star systems, although a few will be neutral,
allied, or controlled by the player's faction.  These may
need to be defended if the enemy is able to incur.

Rather than being "mission based", Starshatter is an
"operational simulation".  Each campaign episode is
broken down into a series of military operations, each
of which occur in a given star system.  Different opera-
tions will have different rules of engagement and victory
conditions.  Some will require the player to secure a
neutral or allied star system from hostile threats.
Others will involve incursion into hostile territory.
Still others will have more limited objectives, such
as securing a friendly position in a neutral system,
without violating neutral airspace or damaging neutral
assets.

Major resources such as space stations, ship yards,
SAM and sensor sites will be part of the fixed universe
design.  Likewise, the initial number, type, and location
of warships is fixed at design time.  It is hoped that
the combination of large numbers of ships and small
random factors (battle outcome, planetary position,
time of attack) will result in increased variety of
enounter for the player.

During the game, the campaign manager must keep track
of the location and make-up of each ship and battle group.
As each ship is destroyed in battle, it must be removed
(permanently) from play.  New ships and battle groups
can be constructed on each side, at a rate dependent
on how many critical resources the side controls.  In
addition, reserves may be advanced from rearward areas
to support an operation.

For each mission, the computer will assemble a mission
profile by selecting one or more objectives, selecting
a location for the battle, and assigning friendly and
enemy forces. The computer can choose randomly from
among the nearby resources to attack (or defend) and
the nearby ships on both sides to fight.

Missions will be generated in accordance with the current
strategic objectives for the operation.  The dynamic
campaign manager will keep a prioritized list of
strategic objectives, mostly related to major fixed
resources.

Before the battle, the player will be given a gene-
rated mission briefing describing the mission objec-
tives, locale, and the makeup of his own group.

Once the player completes the mission (or loses it),
the computer will tally up the losses on both sides
and remove those ships from the campaign roster.  A
generated mission debriefing will detail kills and
losses, pilot ratings, etc.

In order to keep the player doing something interesting,
he will have to be assigned to an attack force, either
a battle group or fighter wing.  Early missions will be
shorter and simpler, with a single objective in a
single system.  Later missions will get more involved,
with multiple objectives and sometimes requiring free
drive travel to other systems.  In addition, the com-
plexity of missions will be modulated by the user's
chosen difficulty level.

Sometimes, the objectives will be enemy forces: e.g.
destroy a fighter wing or cripple a battle group.
Other times, they will be fixed resources like space
stations or fortified moons.  Still other times, they
will be distributed or moving targets: e.g. shut down
interplanetary shipping throughout the system.

At any time, the player's group may get assigned to
a defensive mission (scramble).  This can mean defending
a fixed resource from an incoming enemy attack.  Or it
could mean escorting an important freight convey through
unsecured space.

Mission objectives can be constructed from verb-noun
imperatives:

=======================================================
                     MISCELLANIA

Sensor ships and stations will be important resources in
winning the information war.  Both the player and the AI
will need to exploit and protect them appropriately.

Briefings/Debriefings and other Intelligence Reports
must adequately communicate the overall game situation
to the player in order to allow the player to make
meaningful decisions.  This is crucial to establishing
immersion and making the player care about the outcome
of the game.

Briefings and Info Bursts will be more visceral if they
include simulated "news footage" of the events being
related.


=======================================================
                DYNAMIC CAMPAIGN NOTES

1. Fighter jocks will be allowed to choose from a
   menu of generated missions that have been assigned
   to the player's squadron.

2. Cruiser skippers will be given only one generated
   mission at a time (like KA or SFC), but it will be
   somewhat broader in scope.

3. Carrier admirals will do what exactly?

4. Both cruiser and carrier missions will often start
   in the field or on patrol.  Fighter missions will
   always start and end at a base (carrier|station|
   dirtside starbase).

5. Cruiser and carrier missions will not normally
   include the starsender translation to the area of
   conflict.  The player will only go through the
   sender in real time as part of a mission (not as
   prelude or ending to a mission).

6. Admirals will need to be able to generate orders
   for their forces during the battle.  This implies
   some kind of Op Command workstation.

7. The mission planner algorithm must construct
   generated missions that are "fun", not just logical
   to the campaign.  I have a vague notion of using
   time/distance heuristics to place enemy units as
   "challenges" on the battle field.  e.g. For xxx
   type of mission, place an enemy destroyer yyy
   minutes away from the (player|objective|sender).

8. The generated missions do not have to hang together
   as well as previously planned.  That is, we don't
   need to maintain the feeling that the player is just
   a unit in an RTS game.  Instead, the campaign manager
   is just a device for generating interesting single
   player missions as would be found in any game with
   a static campaign.

   On the other hand, the player should not see any
   obvious contradictions between the big board and
   what occurred during their missions.  That means,
   any kills they witnessed must still be visible
   between missions in the intel report/event log.
